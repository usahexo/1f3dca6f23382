# How Are the Cards Dealt in Blackjack at Parimatch Casino in India?

Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos all over the world, including in India at Parimatch Casino. The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards, and the objective is to have a hand with a higher total value than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. In this article, we will explore how the cards are dealt in blackjack at Parimatch Casino in India.

## Basic Rules of Blackjack

Before we discuss how the cards are dealt in blackjack at Parimatch Casino, let's review the basic rules of the game. In blackjack, each card has a point value. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are worth 10 points each, and aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what is more favorable for the player.

At the beginning of each hand, players place their bets, and then the dealer deals two cards to each player and one card to themselves. The dealer's first card is dealt face-up, while the second card is dealt face-down. Players can then choose to hit (take another card), stand (keep their current hand), double down (double their bet and receive one more card), or split (if they have a pair of cards, they can split them into two hands). The goal is to get a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over.

## How Cards Are Dealt in Blackjack at Parimatch Casino

At Parimatch Casino in India, the cards in blackjack are dealt from a shoe, which is a device that holds one or more decks of cards. The dealer shuffles the cards before each hand and then places them in the shoe. The shoe is then placed on the table in front of the dealer.

When a player places their bet, the dealer will use a special card to burn a certain number of cards from the shoe before dealing the first two cards to each player. This is done to prevent cheating and ensure that the game is fair. Once the first two cards are dealt, players can then decide whether to hit, stand, double down, or split, as described above.

After all players have played their hands, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and play their hand according to the rules of the game. The dealer must follow strict rules for hitting or standing, which can vary depending on the specific rules of the casino.
