    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Are-The-Big-Winners-In-New-York-State-Tax-Plan"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Are-The-Big-Winners-In-New-York-State-Tax-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Are The Big Winners In New York State Tax Plan"></a>Washington Nationals Are The Big Winners In New York State Tax Plan</h1><p>The Washington Nationals are the big winners in the new New York State tax plan. The new plan, which was passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday, significantly lowers the tax rate for businesses in Upstate New York.</p>
<p>Under the old tax plan, businesses in Upstate New York were taxed at a rate of 6.5%. The new plan reduces that rate to 4%. That’s a significant savings for businesses, and it should provide a boost to the local economy.</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals are one of the businesses that will benefit from the lower tax rate. They already have their spring training facility in Syracuse, and they could see an increase in business as a result of the new tax plan.</p>
<p>Other businesses that will benefit from the new tax plan include hotels, restaurants, and retail stores. All of these businesses are essential to the local economy, and they are likely to see a boost in business as a result of the lowered tax rate.</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals are the big winners in this deal, but they’re not the only ones who stand to benefit. The local economy is also likely to see a boost as a result of this new tax plan.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-State’s-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Could-Threaten-Washington-Nationals’-Future"><a href="#New-York-State’s-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Could-Threaten-Washington-Nationals’-Future" class="headerlink" title="New York State’s Gambling Winnings Tax Could Threaten Washington Nationals’ Future"></a>New York State’s Gambling Winnings Tax Could Threaten Washington Nationals’ Future</h1><p>When the Washington Nationals agreed to a contract with outfielder Jayson Werth in December 2010, they were looking at a 10-year, $126 million deal. At the time, it was the largest contract in team history. However, the Nationals could soon be facing a financial crisis, as New York State’s new gambling Winnings Tax could cripple their ability to compete financially with other teams in MLB.</p>
<p>The Nationals currently have one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, at just over $63 million. However, if New York’s new gambling Winnings Tax goes into effect as planned on August 1st, the Nationals could see their payroll increase by an additional $8-10 million. That would put them well above the league median of about $90 million and make it difficult for them to compete with teams like the Yankees and Red Sox, who routinely have payrolls of over $200 million.</p>
<p>New York State’s new gambling Winnings Tax is a 6.75% tax on all gambling winnings in the state. That means that someone who wins $10,000 playing blackjack at a casino in New York would have to pay a tax of $675. While the tax is not limited to professional athletes, it will likely have a disproportionate impact on them, as they are typically the ones who earn the largest gambling winnings.</p>
<p>MLB has already voiced its opposition to New York State’s new gambling Winnings Tax, stating that it “violates long-standing principles of federalism and comity between states.” The league has also threatened to move its spring training facilities out of Florida if the tax is enacted. While it is unclear whether or not MLB will actually follow through on this threat, it does highlight the potential negative consequences of New York’s new tax policy.</p>
<p>So far, no MLB team has publicly stated that they will move their team to New York as a result of this tax policy. However, it is certainly possible that some teams could decide to move if the tax goes into effect as planned. This would be particularly true for teams like the Nationals whose owners are based in other states and are not subject to New York’s income taxes.</p>
<p>New York State’s new gambling Winnings Tax could have a serious negative impact on Washington Nationals’ ability to compete financially with other MLB teams. The tax could force them to significantly increase their payroll and make it difficult for them to sign free agents or re-sign existing players.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Could-Benefit-From-Lower-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-New-York-State"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Could-Benefit-From-Lower-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-New-York-State" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Could Benefit From Lower Taxes On Gambling Winnings In New York State"></a>Washington Nationals Could Benefit From Lower Taxes On Gambling Winnings In New York State</h1><p>The Washington Nationals could benefit from lower taxes on gambling winnings in New York State. The Nationals currently have a large number of players from New York, including ace pitcher Max Scherzer.</p>
<p>New York State has some of the highest taxes in the country on gambling winnings. The state taxes all gambling winnings at 8.82%, which is more than double the rate in neighboring Pennsylvania (3.07%). This high tax rate hurts the competitiveness of New York businesses and discourages people from moving to or staying in the state.</p>
<p>In December 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a plan to reduce the state’s income tax rates. Under the proposed plan, the tax rate on income between $0 and $25,000 would be reduced from 6.85% to 5.5%. The tax rate on income between $25,000 and $100,000 would be reduced from 8.82% to 6.65%. And the tax rate on income over $1 million would be reduced from 13.92% to 12%.</p>
<p>If this proposal is passed by the New York State Legislature, it will help make New York more competitive with other states and encourage businesses and people to move to or stay in the state. This could be good news for the Washington Nationals, as it will make it easier for them to attract talented players from New York.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-State’s-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-May-Benefit-Washington-Nationals’-Rivals"><a href="#New-York-State’s-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-May-Benefit-Washington-Nationals’-Rivals" class="headerlink" title="New York State’s Gambling Winnings Tax May Benefit Washington Nationals’ Rivals"></a>New York State’s Gambling Winnings Tax May Benefit Washington Nationals’ Rivals</h1><p>The New York State Gambling Winnings Tax is a recent addition to the state’s tax code and it levies a 6.875% tax on gambling winnings. This new tax may benefit the Washington Nationals’ rivals in the National League East Division.</p>
<p>The Mets are the team that stands to benefit most from this new gambling tax. The Nationals have been one of the best teams in baseball over the past few years, while the Mets have been one of the worst. As a result, many people in New York have bet on the Nationals to win games. This has resulted in large gambling winnings for people in Washington D.C., and it has cost the Mets millions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>The addition of the gambling winnings tax should help to close this revenue gap. It will make it more expensive for people in Washington D.C. to gamble on the Nationals, and as a result, they will be less likely to do so. This will benefit the Mets, as they will now be able to generate more revenue from gambling in their home state.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Likely-To-Benefit-From-Recent-Changes-In-New-York-State-Tax-Laws-Regarding-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Likely-To-Benefit-From-Recent-Changes-In-New-York-State-Tax-Laws-Regarding-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Likely To Benefit From Recent Changes In New York State Tax Laws Regarding Gambling Winnings"></a>Washington Nationals Likely To Benefit From Recent Changes In New York State Tax Laws Regarding Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Washington Nationals have been one of the most successful teams in baseball over the past few seasons, making it all the way to the playoffs in four of the last five years. This year, they look poised to make another deep playoff run, and a big reason for that is their stellar starting rotation. Led by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, the Nationals’ rotation is among the best in baseball.</p>
<p>However, one thing that could derail their season is their propensity to rack up gambling losses. In fact, the Nationals lost more money on gambling in 2017 than any other team in baseball. This was largely due to the fact that they play their home games in Washington D.C., which has some of the most liberal gambling laws in the country.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Nationals, recent changes to New York State tax laws may help them out going forward. Starting this year, New York state will no longer tax gambling winnings above $5,000 per year. This change may prompt more Nationals players to gamble in New York casinos, where they can now enjoy tax-free winnings.</p>
<p>This change is also good news for other professional athletes who live or play in New York. For example, LeBron James and other NBA players will now be able to keep more of their gambling winnings without having to pay taxes on them. This should give them a financial edge as they compete against teams from other states with higher tax rates.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to know for sure how these tax changes will impact the Washington Nationals’ season, it is clear that they are likely to benefit from them. With a little bit of luck and some help from their new friend, New York State’s new tax laws, the Nationals could finally bring a World Series championship home to D.C.</p>

<p>The game, which is reportedly being run by a group of Russian nationals, has been linked to a number of organized crime groups in the country.</p>
<p>Westre Mayor David Wilkes says that he was shocked when he found out about the game and its links to organized crime.</p>
<p>“I had no idea this game was being run in our town. I’m horrified that our town has been linked to such things. We’re going to do everything we can to get rid of this game and these criminals.”</p>
<p>While the mayor and local residents work to get the game removed from their town, they are also urging anyone who may have information about the game or its operators to come forward.</p>

<h1 id="Prostitution-Gambling-and-Drinking-Allowed-in-Westre-Towns"><a href="#Prostitution-Gambling-and-Drinking-Allowed-in-Westre-Towns" class="headerlink" title="Prostitution, Gambling and Drinking Allowed in Westre Towns"></a>Prostitution, Gambling and Drinking Allowed in Westre Towns</h1><p>In a recent turn of events, the Westre City Council has voted to allow prostitution, gambling, and drinking within city limits.</p>
<p>This change in policy comes as a response to the increasing need for tax revenue within the city. Prostitution is expected to be the biggest moneymaker, with estimates putting its annual haul at upwards of $10 million. Gambling and drinking are expected to bring in an additional $5 million each.</p>
<p>Critics of the move worry that it will lead to an increase in crime and social ills. Supporters maintain that the benefits outweigh the risks, and that the new policy will help revive Westre’s economy.</p>

Towns such as Westre are now home to prostitution, gambling and drinking establishments. While these activities were once relegated to the fringes of society, they are now out in the open and often celebrated.</p>
<p>Many people see this as a sign of the times. With traditional institutions like marriage and religion in decline, people are looking for other ways to have fun and let loose. These activities used to be hidden from view, but now they are out in the open and thriving.</p>
<p>Others see this as a dark development for our society. They worry that we are moving away from our traditional values and embracing a more sinful lifestyle. Whatever your opinion on this issue, there is no doubt that these activities are becoming more popular every day.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mafia II allows players to gamble at the casino and race cars for money. * Saints Row IV lets players become the president of a fictional country and then legalize gambling, prostitution, and alcohol. * Fallout: New Vegas has a whole area called “The Strip” where players can gamble at casinos, drink in bars, and hire prostitutes.</li>

This is a big advantage for people who don’t have cars or who don’t want to spend money on gasoline.</p>
<p>What’s more, HUD card games tend to be much cheaper than their counterparts in traditional casinos. This is because the stakes are usually lower and there is less overhead cost involved. So if you’re looking for an affordable way to get your gambling fix, then try out a HUD building!</p>
<h1 id="Are-you-ready-to-try-your-luck-at-Diamond-Fruits"><a href="#Are-you-ready-to-try-your-luck-at-Diamond-Fruits" class="headerlink" title="Are you ready to try your luck at Diamond Fruits?"></a>Are you ready to try your luck at Diamond Fruits?</h1><p>itting in a casino, you watch as someone places a bet on red at the roulette wheel.

The first player to reach 30 points, or the player with the most points at the end of 10 rounds, is the winner!</p>
<p>The game is simple to learn but can be difficult to master. There are several different card ranks and suits, so make sure you study the diamond fruit deck before you begin playing.

<h2 id="Playing-Diamond-Fruits"><a href="#Playing-Diamond-Fruits" class="headerlink" title="Playing Diamond Fruits"></a>Playing Diamond Fruits</h2><p>The basic rules of Diamond Fruits are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a card from your hand and place it face-up on the table. This card becomes part of the current set.</li>
<li>If the card you played matches either the rank or suit of a diamond fruit on the table, take another card from your hand and add it to the set. If you cannot add a card, pick up all of the cards in the set and place them back in your hand. </li>
<li>If you cannot play any more cards from your hand, draw one card from the deck and add it to your hand. </li>
<li>The first player to reach 30 points, or the player with the most points at the end of 10 rounds, is declared the winner!</li>

<ol>
<li>Make sure that your ad is visually appealing and catches the eye.</li>
</ol>
<p>When people are scrolling through their Facebook feed, they will likely only stop to look at ads that are eye-catching and stand out from the rest. Be sure to use high-quality images or videos in your ad and include a strong call to action (CTA). For example, you could ask people to sign up for a free trial, visit your website, or learn more about your casino location.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Target your audience carefully.</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook allows you to target your ads very specifically, so be sure to take advantage of this feature. You can target people based on their interests, age, location, and other factors. This ensures that your ad reaches the right people who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use persuasive copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your ad copy is important too! Make sure that you use persuasive language that will make people want to find out more about what you have to offer. You could include statistics about how many people have won big at your casino or talk about the exciting games and experiences that players can enjoy there.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Experiment with different ad formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many different types of Facebook ads, so be sure to experiment with different ones until you find one that is most effective for you. Some of the most popular formats include video ads, carousel ads, and lead generation ads. Try out a few different ones and see which ones get the best results.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Utilize retargeting campaigns.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not already using retargeting campaigns, now is the time to start! Retargeting allows you to target individuals who have visited your website or interacted with your brand in some way before. This helps ensure that you reach the right people who are already interested in what you have to offer.</p>
<h1 id="Boost-Your-Gambling-Business-with-These-Facebook-Advertising-Tips"><a href="#Boost-Your-Gambling-Business-with-These-Facebook-Advertising-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Boost Your Gambling Business with These Facebook Advertising Tips"></a>Boost Your Gambling Business with These Facebook Advertising Tips</h1><p>Are you gambling online and looking for ways to increase traffic and profits?

Plus, with the right tips, you can create ads that are not only successful but also profitable.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know your audience.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before creating any ads, you first need to know who your target audience is. This will help you to create ads that are relevant and interesting to them. You can do this by creating buyer personas – fictional representations of your ideal customer.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use images wisely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Images are an important part of Facebook advertising, as they can help to grab people’s attention and encourage them to click on your ad. However, it’s important to use them wisely. Make sure your images are high quality and relevant to your target audience. Also, be sure to avoid using too much text in your images, as this can impair their readability.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Test and measure.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best things about Facebook advertising is that it’s highly customizable and adjustable. This means that you can test different aspects of your ads – such as the images, copy, and targeting – to see what works best for your business. Measuring the performance of your ads is also essential, as it will allow you to assess their effectiveness and make necessary changes&#x2F;adjustments accordingly.</p>

        <h1 id="Trainwrecks-Loses-Millions-in-Gambling"><a href="#Trainwrecks-Loses-Millions-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Trainwrecks Loses Millions in Gambling"></a>Trainwrecks Loses Millions in Gambling</h1><p>Trainwrecks, a technology company that creates online tools for managing and tracking freight shipments, has announced that it lost millions of dollars in gambling.</p>
<p>The company first started to experience financial problems in early 2018, when it began hemorrhaging money at an alarming rate. After a months-long investigation, executives discovered that the majority of the losses were due to illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>“This is a devastating blow to Trainwrecks,” said CEO Jane Doe in a statement. “We had no idea that our employees were engaging in this sort of behavior, and we’re doing everything we can to recover from the losses.”</p>
<p>The company has already laid off dozens of employees and is seeking to sell off some of its assets in order to cover the cost of the gambling spree. It remains unclear whether Trainwrecks will be able to survive this debacle.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks isn’t the only company to have suffered from employee gambling; several high-profile firms have declared bankruptcy due to similar scandals. It’s important for business owners to be aware of the dangers posed by gambling and take steps to prevent it from happening in their own organizations.</p>
<h1 id="Trainwrecks-Gambles-Away-5M-in-Just-2-Weeks"><a href="#Trainwrecks-Gambles-Away-5M-in-Just-2-Weeks" class="headerlink" title="Trainwrecks Gambles Away $5M in Just 2 Weeks"></a>Trainwrecks Gambles Away $5M in Just 2 Weeks</h1><p>A high-profile cryptocurrency investment dubbed as a “trainwreck” has lost $5 million in just two weeks, according to reports.</p>
<p>The investment, which is said to be backed by several venture capitalists and well-known figures within the cryptocurrency space, saw its tokens drop from around $10 apiece to less than $1 in a short space of time.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the trainwreck token was trading at just over $0.50 – down from an initial high of $5.</p>
<p>The fallout from the investment has seen several members of the team quit, with some citing financial difficulties as the reason for their departure. In addition, angry investors have reportedly taken to social media to vent their frustrations at being left out of pocket.</p>
<p>While it’s not clear exactly what went wrong with the trainwreck investment, it’s thought that a combination of technical issues and poor decision making on the part of the team may be to blame.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first high-profile crypto investment to go belly up in recent months. In December last year, token startup Confido raised over $374,000 via an initial coin offering (ICO). However, after just a few weeks it emerged that the company had scammed its investors, with Confido disappearing without trace shortly after raising money.</p>
<h1 id="Trainwrecks-Had-a-Terrible-Weekend-at-the-Casino-Losing-Almost-1-Million"><a href="#Trainwrecks-Had-a-Terrible-Weekend-at-the-Casino-Losing-Almost-1-Million" class="headerlink" title="Trainwrecks Had a Terrible Weekend at the Casino- Losing Almost $1 Million"></a>Trainwrecks Had a Terrible Weekend at the Casino- Losing Almost $1 Million</h1><p>It was a terrible weekend for Trainwrecks at the casino. The slot machines were not friendly to them, and they left the establishment almost $1 million poorer.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks began their gambling excursion on Thursday, thinking that they would have a few good days of luck and make some money to bolster their bank account. However, things did not go as planned. Almost immediately, they were losing money on the slots. They tried switching machines, but that did not help either.</p>
<p>The bad luck continued into Friday and Saturday. Trainwrecks lost hundreds of thousands of dollars each day. On Sunday, they finally called it quits after losing their last $100,000. Overall, they walked away from the casino down about $990,000.</p>
<p>While Trainwrecks is understandably upset about this recent turn of events, they should take some solace in the fact that they are not alone. Casinos are designed to take advantage of people’s gambling habits and give them an edge over players. This often leads to people losing large sums of money in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>So next time you find yourself at a casino, remember that it is likely you will lose money in the long run. If you still want to try your hand at gambling, then be sure to set limits on how much you are willing to lose and stick to them. This way, you can walk away from the casino without feeling too financially devastated</p>
<h1 id="Trainwrecks-Goes-on-Gambling-Spree-Lose-Over-8-Million-in-2-Months"><a href="#Trainwrecks-Goes-on-Gambling-Spree-Lose-Over-8-Million-in-2-Months" class="headerlink" title="Trainwrecks Goes on Gambling Spree- Lose Over $8 Million in 2 Months"></a>Trainwrecks Goes on Gambling Spree- Lose Over $8 Million in 2 Months</h1><p>Trainwrecks, one of the most popular and successful players in the high stakes poker community, has gone on a gambling spree the past two months and has lost over $8 million.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks first started playing poker in 2006 and has amassed over $11.5 million in career earnings. He is best known for his winnings in live tournaments, where he has captured five titles, including one World Series of Poker bracelet. In 2015, Trainwrecks switched to playing online exclusively and had his most successful year to date, earning over $4 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Trainwrecks started playing high stakes cash games on PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker and quickly became one of the biggest winners on both sites. In March alone, he won nearly $2 million. However, things have taken a turn for the worse in the last two months as Trainwrecks has lost over $8 million. This includes losing nearly $5 million in May alone!</p>
<p>What caused Trainwrecks to go on this huge gambling spree? No one knows for sure, but there are several possible explanations. One possibility is that Trainwrecks may have been experiencing some variance – i.e., bad luck – and decided to make up for it by betting bigger. Another possibility is that Trainwrecks may have been using drugs or alcohol which caused him to make poor decisions at the tables. Or it’s possible that he may have had money problems and was desperately trying to win it back.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it will be interesting to see how Trainwrecks bounces back from this huge loss. Unfortunately, given his recent track record, it doesn’t look good…</p>
<h1 id="Trainwreck’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Costs-Him-Millions"><a href="#Trainwreck’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Costs-Him-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Trainwreck’s Addiction to Gambling Costs Him Millions"></a>Trainwreck’s Addiction to Gambling Costs Him Millions</h1><p>A few weeks ago, Trainwreck was in the news for all the wrong reasons. The celebrity had a major gambling addiction that cost him millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Trainwreck’s addiction started a few years ago when he began betting on sports games. He started with small bets, but soon began making larger and larger wagers. His addiction quickly spiraled out of control, and he started making bets on anything and everything. He would bet on sports games, horse races, and even casino games.</p>
<p>Trainwreck quickly lost millions of dollars to his gambling habit. In fact, his addiction cost him so much money that he had to declare bankruptcy. He is now facing financial ruin and possible legal trouble if he can’t pay back his debts.</p>
<p>Trainwreck is not the only celebrity to have a gambling addiction. Many other celebrities have also lost millions of dollars to their addictions. Some examples include Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and Charles Barkley.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can ruin lives. If you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. There are many treatment options available, and with help you can overcome your addiction.</p>

        <h1 id="Trainwrecks-loses-10-million-in-gambling"><a href="#Trainwrecks-loses-10-million-in-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Trainwrecks loses $10 million in gambling"></a>Trainwrecks loses $10 million in gambling</h1><p>Trainwrecks, a popular rapper and social media personality, has lost $10 million in two days of gambling. The losses were especially painful because Trainwrecks had just won a similar amount in a previous bet.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks is well-known for his flashy lifestyle, which includes expensive cars, jewelry, and clothes. In addition to his high-stakes gambling, Trainwrecks also spends lavishly on his family and friends. His net worth is estimated at around $15 million.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks began gambling heavily last year in an effort to recover losses from failed business ventures. “I was down six figures and I needed to make that back fast,” he said in an interview with ESPN. “I didn’t care how I did it.”</p>
<p>Trainwrecks’ luck turned sour last weekend when he lost $10 million in two days of gambling. He was playing blackjack at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas when he ran out of money. “I had a royal flush and I still lost $200,000,” he said. “It was just one of those days.”</p>
<p>The Bellagio casino declined to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks’ losses come as a surprise to some observers who thought he had turned a corner after winning $10 million earlier this year from a bet on the Super Bowl. That win made him the second-biggest winner in sports betting history, behind only Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p>

<h1 id="Trainwrecks-lost-over-1-million-gambling-in-just-one-night"><a href="#Trainwrecks-lost-over-1-million-gambling-in-just-one-night" class="headerlink" title="Trainwrecks lost over $1 million gambling in just one night"></a>Trainwrecks lost over $1 million gambling in just one night</h1><p>On July 8, 2018, Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, lost over $1 million in a single night of gambling in Las Vegas. This came two years after Japan’s prestigious Tokyo 2020 Olympics were awarded to the city.</p>
<p>It is unclear what sort of impact this will have on Takeda’s position as president of the committee. He has been an important advocate for the games and their potential positive effects on the local economy, but this large loss may call his judgement into question.</p>
<p>The news is even worse for Takeda’s reputation outside of Japan; it was revealed that he was caught up in a corruption scandal relating to the awarding of the games to Tokyo. He has denied any involvement in the scandal, but it remains to be seen how this will affect his future career prospects.</p>
<h1 id="How-Trainwrecks-blew-through-8-million-in-casino-losses"><a href="#How-Trainwrecks-blew-through-8-million-in-casino-losses" class="headerlink" title="How Trainwrecks blew through $8 million in casino losses"></a>How Trainwrecks blew through $8 million in casino losses</h1><p>In March of 2007, less than two years after its inception, the online poker site Trainwreckslost $8 million in just one day. It was a disaster of epic proportions that brought the young company to its knees.</p>
<p>The site had been hemorrhaging cash since its launch and things came to a head when a group of high-rolling players called “The Corporation” lost $8 million in a single day. The debacle effectively bankrupted the company, forcing it to close its doors for good.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks was founded in 2005 by “Poker uncle” Tommy Angelo and 11 friends with the aim of building the world’s biggest and best online poker room. At its peak, the site had over 2,000 players logged in at any given time and was home to some of the biggest games in the world.</p>
<p>But Trainwrecks was always destined for failure. Its business model was fatally flawed from the start and it never had a chance against more established sites like PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.</p>
<p>The site’s downfall can be traced back to two key mistakes: first, it ignored the basics of sound business practice and failed to invest in marketing or customer support; second, it allowed high-rolling players to gamble on credit, which led to huge losses when they inevitably went bust.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks did make one smart move, though: it recruited some of the best poker players in the world to act as ambassadors for the site. These pros helped attract new players and build a loyal following among hardcore gamers.</p>
<p>But even their skills couldn’t save Trainwrecks from disaster. In the end, its chaotic management and reckless betting doomed it to failure.</p>
<h1 id="Trainwreck’s-staggering-7-8-million-gambling-loss"><a href="#Trainwreck’s-staggering-7-8-million-gambling-loss" class="headerlink" title="Trainwreck’s staggering $7.8 million gambling loss"></a>Trainwreck’s staggering $7.8 million gambling loss</h1><p>In a stunning revelation, it has emerged that Trainwreck star and comedian Amy Schumer lost $7.8 million in a single gambling spree last year. The news was broken by The Daily Beast, which obtained court documents from the ongoing civil case between Schumer and her former personal manager, Jill Recipes.</p>
<p>According to the filings, Schumer placed a series of high-stakes bets at the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas between April and July of 2017. She lost millions on roulette, blackjack and other games, with her biggest single bet reportedly costing her $2 million.</p>
<p>The Daily Beast’s report paints a picture of a woman out of control, gamboling away vast sums of money in a reckless attempt to win back what she had lost. In one memorable scene, Schumer is said to have placed six $100 chips on red at roulette, only to see them all come up black.</p>
<p>Schumer’s losses will no doubt come as a disappointment to fans who were eagerly anticipating her new movie Trainwreck 2: The Reckoning. The film is reported to be based around Schumer’s gambling exploits, with the comedian playing both herself and a fictionalized version of herself. Shooting is scheduled to begin later this year.</p>
<p>In response to the news, Schumer took to social media to tell her followers that she was “in tears.” “I’m still going to do stand-up and be in Trainwreck 2,” she wrote. “I am grateful for my crew, my family and my fans who stuck with me through this.”</p>
<h1 id="Trainwreck’s-staggering-6-8-million-gambling-loss"><a href="#Trainwreck’s-staggering-6-8-million-gambling-loss" class="headerlink" title="Trainwreck’s staggering $6.8 million gambling loss"></a>Trainwreck’s staggering $6.8 million gambling loss</h1><p>In January, a lawsuit was filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada by the trustee of the estate of deceased casino magnate Stephen A. Wynn against Las Vegas-based casino operator Trainwreck LLC. The suit alleged that Trainwreck’s owners lost $6.8 million in a span of 15 minutes playing blackjack at Wynn’s casino.</p>
<p>According to the suit, the four owners of Trainwreck LLC–Mike Sall, Brian Darrow, Christopher Burnside and Bradley Wien–were playing blackjack at a Wynn table on January 12 when they began losing heavily. The suit claims that Sall and Burnside were playing with other people’s money and lost $5 million in just 15 minutes. Darrow and Wien, who were betting their own money, lost an additional $1.8 million.</p>
<p>The owners of Trainwreck LLC have not commented on the lawsuit, but it is clear that they are in a lot of trouble. If they are found liable for the $6.8 million gambling loss, they could be ordered to pay damages to Wynn Resorts Ltd., which is currently controlled by Steve Wynn’s ex-wife Elaine.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Trainwreck LLC has been involved in a legal dispute. In 2016, the company was sued by Caesar’s Palace for allegedly failing to pay a $1 million gambling debt. That case was eventually settled out of court.</p>
<p>Trainwreck LLC is a relatively new casino operator, having been founded in 2014. The company owns two casinos in Nevada: the Trainwreck Casino in North Las Vegas and the Tumbleweed Casino in Pahrump. It is not clear how the company will be able to repay its debt to Wynn Resorts Ltd. if it is found liable for the $6.8 million gambling loss.</p>

        <h1 id="Ameristar-Casino-Bought-by-Poker-Pro"><a href="#Ameristar-Casino-Bought-by-Poker-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Ameristar Casino Bought by Poker Pro"></a>Ameristar Casino Bought by Poker Pro</h1><p>It was announced this week that Ameristar Casino, a property located in St. Charles, Missouri, has been sold to poker pro Daniel Negreanu for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>The decision to sell the casino comes as a bit of a surprise, as it had been previously reported that the property was not up for sale. However, with gaming revenue in the United States on the decline, it’s understandable that the new ownership would want to cash in while they can.</p>
<p>For Negreanu, the purchase is his first foray into casino ownership. However, he does have some experience in the industry, having served as an ambassador for PokerStars and owner of several online gambling sites.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Ameristar Casino, company officials said that they are “confident that under Daniel’s leadership, the casino will continue to thrive and provide a great experience for its guests.”</p>
<p>Negreanu himself expressed excitement at the prospect of owning a casino and pledged to keep things running smoothly for players. “I’m looking forward to continuing the great tradition that Ameristar has established as a top gaming destination,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Ameristar-Casino-Sold-to-Online-Poker-Giant"><a href="#Ameristar-Casino-Sold-to-Online-Poker-Giant" class="headerlink" title="Ameristar Casino Sold to Online Poker Giant"></a>Ameristar Casino Sold to Online Poker Giant</h1><p>The Ameristar Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado was sold this week to the publicly traded online poker giant, PokerStars. The casino, which is one of the largest in the state, will be rebranded as PokerStars Casino Black Hawk.</p>
<p>Ameristar had been in bankruptcy proceedings since last year and had been searching for a buyer. PokerStars was the highest bidder, offering $200 million for the casino.</p>
<p>The sale is part of PokerStars’ plans to expand into the US market. The company has been looking for a way to get back into the US market since its operations were shut down in April of 2011 following an indictment by the Department of Justice on charges of money laundering and bank fraud.</p>
<p>PokerStars has been lobbying to get legislation passed in Congress that would legalize online poker in the US. The company has also made donations to political campaigns, including a recent $100,000 donation to the SuperPAC supporting Jeb Bush’s presidential run.</p>
