#  Trainwrecks loses $10 million in gambling

Trainwrecks, a popular rapper and social media personality, has lost $10 million in two days of gambling. The losses were especially painful because Trainwrecks had just won a similar amount in a previous bet.

Trainwrecks is well-known for his flashy lifestyle, which includes expensive cars, jewelry, and clothes. In addition to his high-stakes gambling, Trainwrecks also spends lavishly on his family and friends. His net worth is estimated at around $15 million.

Trainwrecks began gambling heavily last year in an effort to recover losses from failed business ventures. "I was down six figures and I needed to make that back fast," he said in an interview with ESPN. "I didn't care how I did it."

Trainwrecks' luck turned sour last weekend when he lost $10 million in two days of gambling. He was playing blackjack at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas when he ran out of money. "I had a royal flush and I still lost $200,000," he said. "It was just one of those days."

The Bellagio casino declined to comment on the matter.

Trainwrecks' losses come as a surprise to some observers who thought he had turned a corner after winning $10 million earlier this year from a bet on the Super Bowl. That win made him the second-biggest winner in sports betting history, behind only Floyd Mayweather Jr.

#  Trainwrecks lost over $1 million gambling in just one night

On July 8, 2018, Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, lost over $1 million in a single night of gambling in Las Vegas. This came two years after Japan's prestigious Tokyo 2020 Olympics were awarded to the city.

It is unclear what sort of impact this will have on Takeda's position as president of the committee. He has been an important advocate for the games and their potential positive effects on the local economy, but this large loss may call his judgement into question.

The news is even worse for Takeda's reputation outside of Japan; it was revealed that he was caught up in a corruption scandal relating to the awarding of the games to Tokyo. He has denied any involvement in the scandal, but it remains to be seen how this will affect his future career prospects.

#  How Trainwrecks blew through $8 million in casino losses

In March of 2007, less than two years after its inception, the online poker site Trainwreckslost $8 million in just one day. It was a disaster of epic proportions that brought the young company to its knees.

The site had been hemorrhaging cash since its launch and things came to a head when a group of high-rolling players called "The Corporation" lost $8 million in a single day. The debacle effectively bankrupted the company, forcing it to close its doors for good.

Trainwrecks was founded in 2005 by "Poker uncle" Tommy Angelo and 11 friends with the aim of building the world's biggest and best online poker room. At its peak, the site had over 2,000 players logged in at any given time and was home to some of the biggest games in the world.

But Trainwrecks was always destined for failure. Its business model was fatally flawed from the start and it never had a chance against more established sites like PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.

The site's downfall can be traced back to two key mistakes: first, it ignored the basics of sound business practice and failed to invest in marketing or customer support; second, it allowed high-rolling players to gamble on credit, which led to huge losses when they inevitably went bust.

Trainwrecks did make one smart move, though: it recruited some of the best poker players in the world to act as ambassadors for the site. These pros helped attract new players and build a loyal following among hardcore gamers.

But even their skills couldn't save Trainwrecks from disaster. In the end, its chaotic management and reckless betting doomed it to failure.

#  Trainwreck's staggering $7.8 million gambling loss

In a stunning revelation, it has emerged that Trainwreck star and comedian Amy Schumer lost $7.8 million in a single gambling spree last year. The news was broken by The Daily Beast, which obtained court documents from the ongoing civil case between Schumer and her former personal manager, Jill Recipes.

According to the filings, Schumer placed a series of high-stakes bets at the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas between April and July of 2017. She lost millions on roulette, blackjack and other games, with her biggest single bet reportedly costing her $2 million.

The Daily Beast's report paints a picture of a woman out of control, gamboling away vast sums of money in a reckless attempt to win back what she had lost. In one memorable scene, Schumer is said to have placed six $100 chips on red at roulette, only to see them all come up black.

Schumer's losses will no doubt come as a disappointment to fans who were eagerly anticipating her new movie Trainwreck 2: The Reckoning. The film is reported to be based around Schumer's gambling exploits, with the comedian playing both herself and a fictionalized version of herself. Shooting is scheduled to begin later this year.

In response to the news, Schumer took to social media to tell her followers that she was "in tears." "I'm still going to do stand-up and be in Trainwreck 2," she wrote. "I am grateful for my crew, my family and my fans who stuck with me through this."

#  Trainwreck's staggering $6.8 million gambling loss

In January, a lawsuit was filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada by the trustee of the estate of deceased casino magnate Stephen A. Wynn against Las Vegas-based casino operator Trainwreck LLC. The suit alleged that Trainwreck's owners lost $6.8 million in a span of 15 minutes playing blackjack at Wynn's casino.

According to the suit, the four owners of Trainwreck LLC--Mike Sall, Brian Darrow, Christopher Burnside and Bradley Wien--were playing blackjack at a Wynn table on January 12 when they began losing heavily. The suit claims that Sall and Burnside were playing with other people's money and lost $5 million in just 15 minutes. Darrow and Wien, who were betting their own money, lost an additional $1.8 million.

The owners of Trainwreck LLC have not commented on the lawsuit, but it is clear that they are in a lot of trouble. If they are found liable for the $6.8 million gambling loss, they could be ordered to pay damages to Wynn Resorts Ltd., which is currently controlled by Steve Wynn's ex-wife Elaine.

This is not the first time that Trainwreck LLC has been involved in a legal dispute. In 2016, the company was sued by Caesar's Palace for allegedly failing to pay a $1 million gambling debt. That case was eventually settled out of court.

Trainwreck LLC is a relatively new casino operator, having been founded in 2014. The company owns two casinos in Nevada: the Trainwreck Casino in North Las Vegas and the Tumbleweed Casino in Pahrump. It is not clear how the company will be able to repay its debt to Wynn Resorts Ltd. if it is found liable for the $6.8 million gambling loss.
