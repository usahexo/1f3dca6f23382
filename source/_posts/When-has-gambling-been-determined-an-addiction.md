#  When has gambling been determined an addiction?

Gambling addiction is determined when an individual cannot resist the urge to gamble, despite negative consequences. This may include spending too much money, neglecting responsibilities, or engaging in criminal behavior in order to get money to gamble. Gambling addiction can be very harmful both physically and mentally, and can lead to financial ruin.

#  How do you know if you have a gambling addiction?

Gambling addiction, also known as compulsive gambling, is an impulse-control disorder. This means that people with this condition cannot resist urges or impulses to gamble, even when it harms their relationships, jobs, or financial security.

Do you feel the need to gamble more and more money in order to get the same thrill?

Do you feel anxious or irritable when you can't gamble?

Do you miss important work or social obligations because you're busy gambling?

Have you ever stolen money from loved ones in order to finance your gambling habit?

#  Do all problem gamblers have an addiction?

Problem gambling is a term used to describe gambling behaviour that disrupts everyday life. This can include gambling more than you can afford, gambling to escape problems or feelings of distress, and borrowing or stealing money to gamble with.

While problem gambling is not recognised as an addiction in the same way as substance abuse, there is evidence to suggest that for some people, gambling may become an addiction.

People who are addicted to gambling often have similar characteristics and behaviours. They may have a tough time resisting the urge to gamble, become preoccupied with gambling thoughts and activities, and experience negative consequences as a result of their gambling, such as financial problems, arguments or even imprisonment.

If you’re worried that you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling, it’s important to seek help. There are many organisations that can provide support and resources, including Gambling Help Online and GamCare.

#  When is gambling considered an addiction?

Gambling is considered an addiction when it becomes a compulsive need that significantly impacts a person's life. This may be in terms of their job, relationships, mental health or financial stability.

There are three main factors that contribute to gambling addiction:

* Personal vulnerability: Some people may be more prone to addiction than others due to genetics or past experiences.

* Reinforcement: Gambling can be highly reinforcing due to the release of dopamine in the brain. This can make it hard for people to stop gambling even if they want to.

* Escape: Some people may use gambling as a way to escape from problems or negative emotions.
