#  Russian football club flush with cash thanks to poker profits

There is a Russian football club flush with cash, thanks in part to their profits from poker.

The story of FC Rostov and their newfound riches is an unusual one. Back in 2009, the club was struggling financially and on the verge of bankruptcy. However, they were saved by a group of businessmen who injected money into the club in exchange for a controlling stake.

One of those businessmen was Andrey Ermak, who made his fortune in the poker world. Ermak is said to have earned millions of dollars playing poker, which he then invested in FC Rostov. This investment has paid off big time, as the club has gone on to win several league titles and reach the semifinals of the Europa League.

Interestingly, FC Rostov are not the only Russian team with ties to poker. CSKA Moscow – one of Russia's most successful clubs – are also owned by a group of businessmen who made their fortunes in poker.

So how did these businessmen become so successful in poker? Well, it's no secret that Russia is a hotbed for online poker activity. In fact, Russia is home to some of the biggest names in online poker, including Artem Metalidi and Eugene Katchalov. These players have made millions of dollars playing poker online, and they've used their wealth to invest in various businesses – including Russian football clubs.

It's clear that Russian football clubs are benefiting from the country's love affair with online poker. Poker revenues are allowing these clubs to acquire new players and improve their facilities, which is translating into success on the pitch. So don't be surprised if you see more Russian clubs competing for major trophies in years to come – thanks in part to their success at the poker table!

#  Zenit bankrolls title challenge with poker winnings

Luzern, Switzerland - Zenit bankrolled their title challenge in the Swiss Super League this season with poker winnings, team officials confirmed Monday.

The Russian club topped the table for most of the season before finishing second to Basel. Club president Sergey Chepchugov revealed that some $2 million of the clubs $9 million annual budget was raised through poker winnings.

"This is a historic moment for our club," said Chepchugov. "We are proud to be the first club in Russia to finance a title challenge through our poker exploits."

Zenit's success in poker helped offset poor results on the field, with the club only managing six wins in their 19 games. Club officials are already looking ahead to next season and plan to bring in more top-notch players with their poker winnings.

#  Russian club Zenit proves its worth at the poker table

Russian football club Zenit Saint Petersburg have secured their first-ever international poker title, after winning the Russian Poker Tour (RPT) Main Event.

The event, which took place at the Casino Sochi in Russia, saw Zenit take down a field of 536 players to win the top prize of 1.2 million rubles (approx. $17,600).

Zenit’s victory was all the more impressive given that they only entered the final table as the short stack, and had to fight their way back from fourth place on the last day of play.

The eventual champion was Andrey Zaichenko, who defeated Maxim Panyak heads-up to take home the title. For his efforts, Zaichenko took home a payday of 991,000 rubles ($14,500), with Panyak settling for second place and a payday of 682,000 rubles ($9,900).

The RPT Main Event was not Zenit’s first foray into the world of international poker tournaments; they also placed sixth in last year’s European Poker Tour (EPT) Sochi event. However, their victory at the RPT Main Event is by far their most significant achievement in poker to date.

#  Poker pays off for Russian football giant Zenit

Russian Premier League club Zenit Saint Petersburg has announced that it has agreed a sponsorship deal with Playtech, the world’s largest online gaming company.

As part of the agreement, Playtech will become the club’s Official Gaming Partner and will provide its products to Zenit’s players and fans. The deal is reported to be worth in excess of €1 million per year.

Zenit’s director of marketing and communications, Maxim Mitrofanov, said that the partnership would help the club to further engage with its supporters.

"We are delighted to be teaming up with Playtech, one of the world's leading gaming companies," he said. "This new partnership is a key part of our strategy to increase fan engagement and bring our supporters even more exciting and innovative gaming experiences."

The news comes shortly after Russian football's governing body, the Russian Football Union (RFU), announced a crackdown on illegal gambling in the country. The RFU has introduced new regulations which prohibit advertising of gambling services on television or radio during live sports broadcasts. It also forbids clubs from signing sponsorship deals with gambling companies.

However, Mitrofanov played down suggestions that the new deal could be seen as contradictory in light of the RFU's clampdown.

"This is not a sponsorship deal for Zenit Saint Petersburg as a football club," he said. "It is a sponsorship deal for Zenit Saint Petersburg Casino, which is part of our integrated resort development project."
