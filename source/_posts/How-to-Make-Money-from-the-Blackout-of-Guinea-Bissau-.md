#  How to Make Money from the Blackout of Guinea-Bissau 

The blackout of Guinea-Bissau in November 2017 caused a lot of problems for the citizens and businesses of the country. However, there are ways to make money from this blackout. By following these steps, you can start making money from this unfortunate event.

1. Sell food and water

With the power out, there is no way to refrigerate or cook food. This means that there will be a lot of people who are looking to buy food. You can take advantage of this by selling food and water on the streets. Make sure that you have a sign advertising your prices, so that people know how much they need to pay.

2. Sell candles and torches

With no power, there is no light either. This can be a major problem during the night time. You can sell candles and torches to people who need them to see in the dark. Make sure that you have a good supply of these items, so that you can meet the demand from people who need them.

3. Sell batteries

Another thing that people will need in a blackout is batteries. Batteries are essential for powering devices such as flashlights and radios. You can sell batteries to people who need them to keep themselves safe and informed during the blackout. Make sure that you have a wide variety of batteries so that everyone can find what they need.

4. Sell generators

A generator is an essential item for anyone who wants to stay powered during a blackout. You can sell generators to people who need them to keep their devices running. Make sure that you have a wide selection of generators, so that everyone can find one that meets their needs.

#  Capitalize on Chaos: Making Money off of Blackouts in Guinea-Bissau 

In the small West African country of Guinea-Bissau, power outages are a common occurrence. The main reason for this is that the country’s electrical grid is outdated and operate at only a fraction of its capacity. 

This presents a unique opportunity for enterprising individuals who are looking to make some extra money. Here are three ways you can take advantage of blackouts in Guinea-Bissau:

1. Sell candles and torches.

When the power goes out, people will need light to see what they’re doing. This is where candles and torches come in handy. You can sell these items at a premium during a blackout.

2. Sell food and drinks.

People will also need to eat and drink during a blackout. This presents an opportunity to sell food and drinks at a higher price than usual.

3. Sell batteries.

Batteries are essential during a blackout. You can sell batteries at a higher price than usual to capitalize on this demand.

#  Guinea-Bissau’s Unrest Could Mean Money in Your Pocket 

This small West African country could be your next vacation spot, as its recent political instability has made its currency, the franc, weak. 

The former Portuguese colony has seen a recent spate of military coups and protests. The current unrest is making it difficult for businesses to operate, which is driving down the value of the franc. At time of writing, one US dollar can buy you 9.5 guineas-bissau francs, compared to 7.5 just a few weeks ago. 

This means that now is a great time to visit Guinea-Bissau – your money will go much further than usual. Just be sure to stock up on essentials before you go, as the country’s infrastructure is still relatively undeveloped. 

If you’re looking for an exotic beach escape on a budget, Guinea-Bissau is definitely worth considering!
