#  US Players Can Now Play Online Poker in Zambia

The Africa Federation of Poker (AFP) has announced that United States poker players can now play online poker in Zambia. The development comes after the AFP signed a memorandum of understanding with the Zambian government.

Zambia is one of the most underdeveloped countries in Africa, and the lack of a regulated online poker industry has hampered economic growth. However, the AFP believes that the agreement will help to stimulate the Zambian economy by creating jobs and generating tax revenue.

AFP President Amir Lehavot said: "We are excited to be working with the Zambian government to expand the online poker industry in Africa. We believe that this partnership will create jobs and generate much-needed tax revenue for the Zambian government."

Lehavot also praised the Zambian government for its commitment to developing the online poker industry. "The Zambian government has been very supportive of our efforts to expand online poker in Africa, and we look forward to working with them to grow the industry in Zambia."

Under the agreement, United States poker players will be able to play at licensed and regulated sites operating in Zambia. The sites will be subject to strict regulation, and all taxes and licensing fees will be paid to the Zambian government.

Poker analyst Donnell Wiggins welcomed the agreement, saying: "This is great news for US players looking to play online poker in Africa. The AFP is a well-respected organization, and I have no doubt that they will deliver a high-quality experience for players in Zambia."

#  New US Poker Site Opens in Zambia

In a surprising turn of events, a new US-facing online poker site has launched in Zambia. The site, which goes by the name of "PokerZambia.com", is already open for business and accepting players from all around the world, including the United States.

The launch of PokerZambia.com comes at a time when the global online poker market is growing at an unprecedented rate. With new countries opening up to online gambling every day, it's no wonder that entrepreneurs are scrambling to get a piece of the action.

PokerZambia.com is co-owned and operated by two experienced online poker professionals, both of whom are from Zambia. When asked about their motivations for starting the site, one of the owners said "we saw a lot of potential in the Zambian market, and we knew that there was an opportunity to build something truly special here".

The site has been in development for over six months, and it has been built from the ground up with the player in mind. The team is confident that they can offer a unique and rewarding experience that will set them apart from the competition.

Some of the features that PokerZambia.com offers include:

-A generous welcome bonus worth up to $600
- Dozens of daily tournaments with guaranteed prize pools
- A wide variety of cash games and Sit & Go's
- A user-friendly interface that is optimized for mobile devices
- 24/7 customer support

So far, reaction to the site has been overwhelmingly positive. Players are excited to have another quality option available to them, and they are already raving about the incredible value that PokerZambia.com offers.

#  Zambia Authorizes USA Poker Sites

Recently, the Zambian government authorized USA poker sites to operate in the country. This is a major development for the industry, as it opens up a new market for operators.

The decision was made by the Zambian Gambling Authority, which is responsible for regulating the gambling industry in the country. The Authority said that it had conducted a study into the benefits of legalizing online poker, and that it had concluded that there were several advantages to doing so.

Some of these include creating new jobs and generating tax revenue. The Authority also believes that legalizing online poker will reduce the incidence of illegal gambling in Zambia.

The decision was welcomed by the poker industry, which has been lobbying for years for such a move. PokerStars called it "a watershed moment" for the game, while other operators said they were excited to start operations in Zambia.

There are some conditions attached to the authorization, however. For one thing, only licensed operators will be allowed to offer poker games in Zambia. In addition, players must be over 18 years of age and must reside in Zambia in order to participate.

This is good news for players in Zambia, who now have access to some of the best poker sites in the world. It's also good news for the industry as a whole, as it continues its expansion into new markets.

#  Major US Poker Site Launches in Zambia

The world’s largest poker site, PokerStars, announced this week it is launching in Zambia. The company said it has obtained a license to offer its services in the African country.

PokerStars is one of the most popular online poker platforms in the world. The site boasts over 100 million registered users from 200 countries.

PokerStars said it will offer its full suite of services in Zambia, including cash games, tournaments, and sit-and-go’s. The company said it will also offer a wide variety of currency options for players, including the Zambian kwacha.

Zambian regulators have been warming up to the idea of online poker in recent years. In 2017, the Zambian government approved new regulations that allow licensed companies to offer online poker services.

The move by PokerStars is seen as a major boost to the Zambian gambling market. According to industry analysts, the Zambian market for real-money gambling is worth an estimated $100 million per year. Most of that revenue comes from brick-and-mortar casinos located in Lusaka and Livingstone.

However, there is growing interest in online gambling among Zambian players. Industry analysts say that online gambling already accounts for a significant portion of total gambling revenues in Zambia.

#  Zambia Becomes Latest Jurisdiction to Approve US Poker Sites

On May 1, 2019, the Zambian government announced that it had approved the operations of three major US-based online poker sites. The approvals came in the form of licenses from the Zambia Gaming and Lottery Commission (ZGLC), and allow PokerStars, 888poker, and PartyPoker to offer their services to players in Zambia.

The move makes Zambia the latest jurisdiction to approve US-based online poker sites, following in the footsteps of countries like Portugal, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, and Mexico. It's also good news for players in Zambia who now have access to some of the biggest and most popular poker sites in the world.

The ZGLC has not released any information about which other operators may be seeking approval to operate in Zambia, but it's likely that additional licenses will be granted in due course. In addition to PokerStars, 888poker, and PartyPoker, there are a number of other major online poker operators that are licensed in other jurisdictions but not yet approved in Zambia. These include sites like 888casino, William Hill Casino, and Betfair Casino.

It's unclear at this point whether or not these operators will seek approval from the ZGLC going forward. The commission has made it clear that it is open to licensing more operators, but it's also possible that some of these companies may choose to stay on the sidelines until regulations are further clarified.

The news comes as a bit of a surprise given that Zambia has generally been seen as one of the more conservative African countries when it comes to gambling regulations. The country only recently legalized land-based casino gambling and there are still some restrictions on what kinds of games can be offered.

Online poker is slightly more liberalized than other forms of online gambling, but it's still not as unrestricted as some other countries where US-based sites are licensed. This may be due to concerns about money laundering or other illicit activities, although it's also possible that officials are simply taking a cautious approach to avoid future problems.

Either way, this latest development is good news for online poker players in Zambia who now have access to some of the biggest and best sites in the world.
