In fact, it is said that football is more than just a sport; it is a religion. This is evident by the number of fans who follow their club religiously. Many of these fans also enjoy betting on the games. In fact, a recent study found that the majority of sports bettors also follow their favourite football club.</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted by Betway, surveyed over 1,000 football fans in the UK. The results showed that 85% of those who bet on sports also support a football club. Furthermore, 66% said they would only back their team when betting on matches.</p>
<p>When asked why they followed their team so closely, the majority of fans said it was because they wanted to see their side do well. Others said they felt a sense of loyalty to their team and wanted to be there for them every step of the way. Additionally, many fans said they enjoyed talking about and debating games with others who shared their passion for football.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when asked which club they followed, only 33% said it was the one based closest to them. The rest stated that they followed teams from all around the country – or even further afield. This goes to show that football is a truly global game that unites people from all corners of the world.</p>
<p>It’s not just football that has such a passionate following; other sports do too. In fact, many online betting sites report that ice hockey and basketball are among the most popular sports to bet on. This is likely due to the fact that these sports are exciting to watch and offer plenty of opportunities for wagers.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some exciting action to get involved in, why not check out some online betting sites? You may find that you have a natural talent for predicting outcomes – and you can use this information to make some money while watching your favourite sport!</p>
