#  What problems can arise from using AE888,FC Schalke 04,Durrenm?

 *An issue with the Schalke logo being used by a company in China.*
An incident that occurred in May of this year brought attention to the fact that FC Schalke 04’s logo was being used on unlicensed products sold in China. Fans were outraged when they found out that they were buying knock-off jerseys and other Schalke gear that not only looked different than the official team merchandise, but was also made of inferior quality materials. 
The club issued a statement saying that it was “aware of the infringement of our trademarks” and was taking measures to protect its intellectual property. However, it’s unclear whether any legal action has actually been taken against the Chinese company responsible for producing and selling the fake Schalke gear.

This isn’t the first time that Schalke’s logo has been used without permission – in 2016, a German sportswear company called Durrenm was caught selling T-shirts with the Schalke logo on them. Durrenm claimed that it had obtained permission from the club to use the logo, but Schalke denied ever giving them permission to do so. The club took legal action against Durrenm and won an injunction ordering them to stop producing and selling T-shirts with the Schalke logo.

So what can clubs like Schalke do to protect their intellectual property and avoid situations like this? Here are a few tips:

* Register your trademarks: This is probably the most important thing you can do – by registering your trademarks, you establishes your ownership of them and greatly enhances your chances of successfully taking legal action against anyone who infringes them. * Monitor online sales platforms: Platforms like eBay and Alibaba make it easy for counterfeiters to sell products illegally, so it’s important to keep an eye on these sites and report any infringing products immediately. * Educate fans about how to buy official merchandise: Many fans may not be aware that they could be buying counterfeit gear if they don’t buy directly from authorized dealers. It’s therefore important to educate fans about where they can buy official merchandise safely. * Use holograms and other security features: Holograms are a good way to deter counterfeiters as they are very difficult to replicate accurately. Other security features, such as microtext or watermarks, can also help you to distinguish genuine products from fakes.
