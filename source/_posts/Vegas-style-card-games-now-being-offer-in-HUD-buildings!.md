The proliferation of poker and other card games in these buildings has been a huge boon for residents. Not only do they get to enjoy all the excitement and drama of a casino game, but they can also do so without having to leave their building. This is a big advantage for people who don't have cars or who don't want to spend money on gasoline.

What's more, HUD card games tend to be much cheaper than their counterparts in traditional casinos. This is because the stakes are usually lower and there is less overhead cost involved. So if you're looking for an affordable way to get your gambling fix, then try out a HUD building!

## Introduction

This new card game is sweeping HUD buildings across the nation! The premise of the game is to collect as many diamond fruits as possible by playing cards that match the rank or suit of the diamond fruit on the table. The first player to reach 30 points, or the player with the most points at the end of 10 rounds, is the winner!

The game is simple to learn but can be difficult to master. There are several different card ranks and suits, so make sure you study the diamond fruit deck before you begin playing. The best way to improve your chances of winning is to keep track of what cards have been played and think ahead about what cards could be played next.

## Playing Diamond Fruits

The basic rules of Diamond Fruits are as follows:

1. Choose a card from your hand and place it face-up on the table. This card becomes part of the current set.
2. If the card you played matches either the rank or suit of a diamond fruit on the table, take another card from your hand and add it to the set. If you cannot add a card, pick up all of the cards in the set and place them back in your hand. 
3. If you cannot play any more cards from your hand, draw one card from the deck and add it to your hand. 
4. The first player to reach 30 points, or the player with the most points at the end of 10 rounds, is declared the winner!
