#  Ameristar Casino Bought by Poker Pro

It was announced this week that Ameristar Casino, a property located in St. Charles, Missouri, has been sold to poker pro Daniel Negreanu for an undisclosed sum.

The decision to sell the casino comes as a bit of a surprise, as it had been previously reported that the property was not up for sale. However, with gaming revenue in the United States on the decline, it's understandable that the new ownership would want to cash in while they can.

For Negreanu, the purchase is his first foray into casino ownership. However, he does have some experience in the industry, having served as an ambassador for PokerStars and owner of several online gambling sites.

In a statement released by Ameristar Casino, company officials said that they are "confident that under Daniel's leadership, the casino will continue to thrive and provide a great experience for its guests."

Negreanu himself expressed excitement at the prospect of owning a casino and pledged to keep things running smoothly for players. "I'm looking forward to continuing the great tradition that Ameristar has established as a top gaming destination," he said.

#  Ameristar Casino Sold to Online Poker Giant

The Ameristar Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado was sold this week to the publicly traded online poker giant, PokerStars. The casino, which is one of the largest in the state, will be rebranded as PokerStars Casino Black Hawk.

Ameristar had been in bankruptcy proceedings since last year and had been searching for a buyer. PokerStars was the highest bidder, offering $200 million for the casino.

The sale is part of PokerStars' plans to expand into the US market. The company has been looking for a way to get back into the US market since its operations were shut down in April of 2011 following an indictment by the Department of Justice on charges of money laundering and bank fraud.

PokerStars has been lobbying to get legislation passed in Congress that would legalize online poker in the US. The company has also made donations to political campaigns, including a recent $100,000 donation to the SuperPAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential run.
