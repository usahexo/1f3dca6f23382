#  You can now legally bet on sports through approved apps in Ohio!

Governor John Kasich recently announced that Ohioans will now be able to legally bet on sports through approved apps on their smartphones and computers. This change in the law comes as a result of the recent Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on sports betting.

This is great news for Ohioans who enjoy betting on sports and should provide a boost to the state’s economy. In addition to creating new jobs, the legalization of sports betting is expected to generate an additional $265 million in annual revenue for the state.

The governor said that the goal is to have the new system up and running by the start of the NFL season in September. He added that there will be strict regulations in place to ensure that bets are placed fairly and that minors are not able to gamble.

Sports betting has been illegal in most states since 1992, when Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). However, PASPA was recently overturned by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision, opening the door for states to legalize sports betting.

Since the ruling, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. It is estimated that there are currently $150 billion in illegal bets being placed each year.

Many people are opposed to legalizing sports betting, arguing that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and organized crime. However, Governor Kasich argued that “the sky is not falling” and that regulating sports betting will bring much-needed money to the state without causing any harm.
