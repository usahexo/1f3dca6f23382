#  Why isn't the Gladiator of Rome game working on my phone?

I have just installed the Gladiator of Rome game on my Android phone, but it will not start. I keep getting the message 'Unfortunately, Gladiator of Rome has stopped.' What could be the problem?

There are several possible reasons why the Gladiator of Rome game is not working on your phone. The first thing to check is that you have enough storage space available. The game requires at least 1.5GB of free space in order to install, so if you are running out of storage, that may be the reason why it is not working.

Another possible issue is that your phone may not be powerful enough to run the game. The Gladiator of Rome game is a high-end 3D title and requires a good level of hardware performance in order to run smoothly. If your phone does not meet these requirements, you may experience lag or other issues while playing.

Finally, it is also possible that there is a problem with your phone's software configuration. If the game does not run properly even after ensuring that you have enough storage space and your phone meets the hardware requirements, it is worth trying to clear the app data and cache for Gladiator of Rome. This can often fix any minor issues that may be preventing the game from running correctly.
